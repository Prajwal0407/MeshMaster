# MeshMaster
Mesh Master is a powerful Blender addon designed to streamline mesh cleanup, export, and turnaround rendering. It combines intelligent cleanup tools, batch export functionality, and automatic turnaround renders with dynamic lighting, all accessible from the Sidebar.

Features
ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Tools

Perform batch cleanup on selected mesh objects to improve mesh quality and consistency.

Merge By Distance: Merge vertices that are closer than a threshold.

Recalculate Normals: Make normals consistent.

Make Normals Outward: Ensure all normals face outward for correct shading.

Delete Loose Geometry: Remove isolated vertices, edges, or faces.

Fill Mesh Holes: Automatically fill small holes in the mesh.

Triangulate Faces: Convert all faces to triangles for cleaner topology.

Apply Transforms: Apply location, rotation, and scale transformations.

Select N-gons: Select all faces with more than 4 vertices.

Export FBX Button: Quickly export with the selected settings.

ðŸŽ¥ Turnaround Render

Automatically generate multiple renders of your object rotating around its center with smart lighting.

Output Directory: Set where rendered images are saved.

Resolution: Set X and Y resolution for renders.

Number of Angles: Number of images around the object (360Â° divided by this number).

Image Format: PNG or JPEG.

Renderer: Cycles, Eevee, or Workbench.

Enable Clay Material: Replace object materials with a clay shader for consistent lighting.

Rim Light Color & Power: Customize lighting color and intensity for renders.

Render Turnaround Button: Automatically render multiple angles and clean up temporary lights/camera after rendering.
