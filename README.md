| **Option**                | **Description**                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Merge By Distance**     | Merge vertices that are close together.         |
| **Recalculate Normals**   | Make normals consistent across the mesh.        |
| **Make Normals Outward**  | Ensure all normals face outward.                |
| **Delete Loose Geometry** | Remove unconnected vertices, edges, or faces.   |
| **Fill Mesh Holes**       | Automatically fill small holes in the mesh.     |
| **Triangulate Faces**     | Convert all faces to triangles.                 |
| **Apply Transforms**      | Apply location, rotation, and scale transforms. |
| **Select N-gons**         | Select all faces with more than four sides.     |


Click Run Cleanup to execute all selected cleanup operations at once.

**üì§ Export Tools**

Batch-export selected (or all) meshes as FBX with fine control.

| **Selected Objects Only** | Export only selected meshes or all in the scene. |


Press Export FBX to export meshes automatically.

**üìç Origin Tools**

Quickly change the pivot/origin of your mesh to precise bounding box positions.

| **Button**  | **Description**                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **+X / -X** | Move origin to the right or left side. |
| **+Y / -Y** | Move origin to the front or back.      |
| **+Z / -Z** | Move origin to the top or bottom.      |
| **Center**  | Move origin to the center of the mesh. |


Useful for aligning pivots before exporting or animating.

**üé• Turnaround Render**

Render a full 360¬∞ preview of your model with intelligent lighting setup.

| **Option**               | **Description**                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Output Directory**     | Folder for rendered images.                     |
| **Resolution X / Y**     | Output render resolution.                       |
| **Image Format**         | Choose between PNG or JPEG.                     |
| **Renderer**             | Cycles, Eevee, or Workbench.                    |
| **Number of Angles**     | Number of renders per full rotation.            |
| **Enable Clay Material** | Use a neutral material for consistent lighting. |
| **Rim Light Color**      | Color of the rim light.                         |

Click Render Turnaround to automatically:
Create a temporary camera and lights.
Rotate around the object evenly.
Save all rendered frames to your selected directory.

**üß© How It Works**

Mesh Master creates a property group (thegoodtools) that stores all your preferences per scene. Operators access these properties and perform Blender‚Äôs built-in mesh, export, and render operations in sequence ‚Äî all from one easy UI.

**üß∞ Technical Notes**

Works best in Object Mode when running cleanup or export tools.
Turnaround renders temporarily create and delete lights/camera after completion.
Exports use Blender‚Äôs native FBX exporter for compatibility.
Origin tools operate based on the object‚Äôs bounding box in world space.
